Welcome to your very own Password Manager! This tool helps you securely store, generate, and manage all your passwords in one place. With its sleek design and simple interface, keeping your passwords safe has never been easier.

Features:
Password Generator: Quickly generate strong and secure passwords with the click of a button.
Password Strength Checker: Analyze the strength of your passwords to ensure they’re safe from hackers.
Secure Storage: Save your passwords safely and retrieve them whenever you need them.

Beautiful Design: A vibrant and modern user interface that’s easy on the eyes and simple to navigate.
How It Works:
Set Your PIN: When you first open the Password Manager, you'll be asked to set a 4-digit PIN. This PIN will act as the key to unlock your password manager.
Generate Strong Passwords: Use the “Generate Password” button to create a strong, random password that’s hard to crack.
Check Password Strength: Input any password and check its strength to make sure it’s secure enough.
Save Your Passwords: For each site you use, save your passwords in the list. This way, you can come back and view or copy them whenever needed.
Pin Protection: Every time you open the password manager, you will need to enter the PIN to access your stored passwords.
How to Use:
Open the Password Manager: Upon opening, you’ll be prompted to either set a new PIN (if this is your first time) or enter your existing PIN to log in.
Generate a Password: Hit the "Generate Password" button, and a secure password will appear. You can copy it directly to your clipboard by clicking "Copy."
Save Your Passwords: To save a password, enter the website’s name and the generated password into the input fields, and click the "Save Password" button.
View Saved Passwords: Your saved passwords will be displayed in a neat list, where you can copy or delete them as needed.
Security Considerations:
PIN-based Authentication: Your password manager is protected by a 4-digit PIN that you set. This ensures only you can access your saved passwords.
Encrypted Password Storage: Passwords are stored securely in the browser's local storage and are encoded to keep them safe.
No Server-Side Storage: This password manager operates completely on the client-side, meaning your data is never sent over the internet.
Setup:
Simply open the HTML file in your browser, and you're good to go! There's no need for installation or complicated setup steps. This is a purely front-end web application, so it works seamlessly on any device that supports modern browsers.

Future Improvements:
Cloud Sync: Sync your saved passwords across multiple devices.
Browser Extensions: Integrate this manager into your browser for easy, on-the-go access.
Biometric Authentication: Implement fingerprint or face recognition for added security.
